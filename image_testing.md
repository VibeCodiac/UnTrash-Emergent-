# Image Integration Testing Playbook

## Image Handling Rules
- Always use base64-encoded images for all tests and requests
- Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, WEBP only
- Do not use SVG, BMP, HEIC, or other formats
- Do not upload blank, solid-color, or uniform-variance images
- Every image must contain real visual features — such as objects, edges, textures, or shadows
- If the image is not PNG/JPEG/WEBP, transcode it to PNG or JPEG before upload

## Fix Example:
If you read a .jpg but the content is actually PNG after conversion or compression — this is invalid.
Always re-detect and update the MIME after transformations.

## Additional Rules:
- If the image is animated (e.g., GIF, APNG, WEBP animation), extract the first frame only
- Resize large images to reasonable bounds (avoid oversized payloads)

## Testing Steps:
1. Test with real trash images
2. Test with clean area images
3. Verify AI correctly identifies trash presence
4. Test edge cases (blurry images, night photos, etc.)
