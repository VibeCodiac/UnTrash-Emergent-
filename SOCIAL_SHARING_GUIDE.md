### 3. Backend Access
**You DON'T need to access the backend!**

The backend is an API that runs automatically. Everything you need is in the frontend (the web interface you see).

The frontend talks to the backend automatically when you:
- Report trash
- Collect trash
- Join groups
- View medals
- Check rankings

You never need to visit the backend URL directly!
